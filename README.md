# Takodachi-Hunt

This was my first game I have developed in Unity! An FPS shooter featuring Takodachis as the enemy entities.


All the complex building structures and Takodachi models were made by various authors from https://sketchfab.com
The scripts were referenced by the YouTuber https://brackeys.com/ and modified for my application.

The latest build can be downloaded here! https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dv1QiGMwQJHaGS7oEvbLZpKzl-paXoVw/view?usp=sharing
