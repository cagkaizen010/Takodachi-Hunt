This was my first game I have developed in Unity! An FPS shooter featuring Takodachis as the enemy entities.
<br>
All the complex building structures and Takodachi models were made by various authors from https://sketchfab.com<br>
The scripts were referenced by the YouTuber https://brackeys.com/ and modified for my application.
